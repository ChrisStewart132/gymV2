{"href":"https://weighttraining.guide/articles/how-genetics-affect-weight-training-progression/","Hormone production":" various hormones, particularly testosterone, are directly responsible for the anabolic processes that facilitate muscle growth. While hormone production can be influenced by a number of variables, genetics often dictate which end of the spectrum a person’s hormone levels will reside, with low testosterone even being known as a hereditary trait","Myostatin levels":" myostatin is a protein responsible for limiting the body’s ability to put on muscle mass. This limitation of muscle growth is meant to help the body preserve energy in cases of survival, as larger muscles burn through more energy than smaller ones do. A person’s myostatin levels can widely fluctuate if they have any mutations in their MSTN gene, which is directly responsible for myostatin regulation. Individuals with low ranges of myostatin are able to put on far more muscle mass than the average person can, with professional bodybuilders often being a prime example","Muscle fiber type proportions":" type II muscle fibers (fast-twitch fibers) are largely responsible for the size and growth of a muscle. Certain muscle groups, such as the four quadriceps muscles, are naturally composed of a higher percentage of fast-twitch fibers than slow-twitch fibers (type I). Additionally, men often possess a higher ratio of fast-twitch fibers than women do","Bone mineral density":" bones that have a high mineral density are stronger than those that do not. If an individual’s bones are not sufficiently dense, muscle growth can be negatively impacted. This is because the bones must be strong enough to support the muscle’s weight and contraction strength (which pulls on the bones)","name":"How genetics affect weight training progression","image":"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%221320%22%20height=%22880%22%3E%3C/svg%3E","tags":[]}
